# Portfolio-V2
The second iteration of my professional web development portfolio.

This is a total rework and departure from the design of my first portfolio. This portfolio features Bulma, a responsive framework that enabled me to integrate a much more sophisticated and clean design. 

My portfolio features links to my professional resume, my GitHub and my LinkedIn account. There are also links to programming assignments.My resume features links to my portfolio, as well as links to a group project and a few programming assignments. 

To see how far my portfolio has already come, check out the link below to my first portfolio!

My first portfolio: https://lukemcm89.github.io/Initial-Portfolio/

In the future, I would like to re-scale the size of my profile photo. I wasn't able to figure out how to  get it to an adequate size. I would also like to get the contact form to function correctly. 


Thank you for your time!
